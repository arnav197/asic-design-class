# First Session: Compiling a C program using GCC and RISC-V

## 1. Compiled C code over GCC (O1)
**1.1** A simple C code which calculates the sum of numbers upto 5 is run over GCC in the manner discussed. 
 
 Firstly, a text editor is used to write the code as shown below. We use leafpad.

![Screenshot displaying the code and leafpad prompt](createfile.png)

In the screenshot posted above, leafpad is summoned using the **leafpad sum1ton.c** command. Here, **sum1ton.c** is the C program file which contains our code. Therefore, write the code in it. And save it, obviously.

**1.2** Going ahead, compile the written C code in the manner shown below.

![Compilation and Executable](01gcccompilation.png)

**gcc sum1ton.c** command compiles the C program and an executable is created. 

Also shown is the process to run the executable **a.out** which is the default executable generated by the gcc. The output can be made out, which is 15. **We will call it O1**.
